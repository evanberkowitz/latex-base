# latex-base
An example of my preferred use of LaTeX + git.

For more information, clone and `make`.  `master.pdf` explains what's going on here.

# A base for other documents

Rather than forking this repository, it probably makes sense to use it as a base to import.  You can [import a repo on GitHub](https://github.com/new/import) and give it an independent history without keeping it tied to the original repo forever.

# Dependencies

Mandatory:

 - `git`
 - `make`
 - A LaTeX installation.
 
Optional:

 - [`watchman`](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/), for continuous TeX recompilation.
 - [`git latexdiff`](https://gitlab.com/git-latexdiff/git-latexdiff), for producing PDFs with diff highlighting.
