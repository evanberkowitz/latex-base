\section{Introduction}

\LaTeX is a system for producing beautiful documents.
It takes as input a set of plain text files, and produces a variety of output types; the most useful to me is PDF.

\git is a decentralized version control system.
It's fantastic.

This repo\cite{latex-base} is an example that is supposed to make it easy to make \git-controlled \LaTeX documents.
In particular, I have written \git hooks that ensure individual commits successfully produce a PDF and ensure that after a pull the PDF is automatically recompiled with the latest edits.
That helps keep everybody\ldots\ on the same page.

I also have a small shell script that reports the status of the repo when the PDF is being compiled.
The script \texttt{git\_information.sh} produces \texttt{git\_information.tex} which looks, in the current example, like
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\gitmarginsetup}{
    \usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}
    \usepackage[ angle=90, color=black, opacity=1, scale=2, ]{background}
    \SetBgPosition{current page.west}
    \SetBgVshift{-4.5mm}
    \backgroundsetup{contents={{\color{Red}1 file different from 
        commit 770ae8c from 2018-11-05 14:52:08 +0100}}}
}\end{verbatim}
The one dirty file is the one I'm working on---\texttt{section/introduction.tex}.
To get the \git status on the left margin of every page I simply invoke \texttt{make DRAFT=1}.
One may invoke \make alone or use, for example, \texttt{pdflatex master.tex}, to produce a PDF without the \git information in the margin.
