\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\LaTeX is a system for producing beautiful documents.
It takes as input a set of plain text files, and produces a variety of output types; the most useful to me is PDF.

\git is a decentralized version control system.
It's fantastic.
There is a version control package, \texttt{vc}\cite{vc} which provides some of the same functionality provided here; you may be better off with that, depending on your use case.

This repo\cite{latex-base} is an example that is supposed to make it easy to make \git-controlled \LaTeX documents.
In particular, I have written \git hooks that ensure individual commits successfully produce a PDF and ensure that after a pull the PDF is automatically recompiled with the latest edits.
That helps keep everybody\ldots\ on the same page.
